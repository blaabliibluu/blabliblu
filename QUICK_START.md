## ⚡ Minimum Required Changes (3 minutes)

If you're short on time, ONLY these are required:

1. **Music URL** - Add your song file
2. **Password** - Change question & answer
3. **Test** - Make sure it unlocks

Everything else can stay as template text for now!

## 🎯 Full Personalization (2-3 hours)

For maximum impact, customize:

- All memory stories → Make them YOUR memories
- Quiz questions → Use YOUR inside jokes
- Love letters → Write from YOUR heart
- 50 reasons → List YOUR specific reasons
- Confession → Use YOUR words

**The more personal = The more powerful!**

Run through this flow:

1. Open `index.html`
2. Enter password → Should unlock
3. Click each memory card → Should open modal
4. Progress through quiz → Should show responses
5. Open each of the 6 letters → Should display without overlap

## 🆘 Quick Troubleshooting

**Music won't play:**
→ Check if URL ends in `.mp3` and is direct download link
→ Browser may block autoplay - user needs to click play button

**Password stuck:**
→ Verify `correctAnswer` variable matches your answer exactly
→ It's case-insensitive, so "Park" = "park"

**Messages not saving:**
→ They save to localStorage as backup
→ Check browser console (F12) for errors

**Mobile looks weird:**
→ Clear cache and reload
→ Try different mobile browser
